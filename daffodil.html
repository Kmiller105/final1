        Daffodils are cheerful spring flowers known for their bright yellow petals and trumpet shaped corona. They are native to Europe and North Africa and are often associated with new begginnings and rebirth. Daffodils are popular in gardens and floral arrangements, blooming in early spring to add a splash of color to the landscape.
